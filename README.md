# ATOC REU Python Bootcamp

Welcome to the ATOC REU Python Bootcamp!

This Bootcamp was created to support student participants in the University of Colorado Boulder Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences **Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) in Data Science**.

The ATOC REU Python Bootcamp was created, and has been maintained, as a department-wide effort since 2021. As it has been edited both with and without Github, **‘commits’ are not the most accurate measure of contribution**. As such, all contributors to these notebooks are listed below (in alphabetical order):
* Nathan Agarwal
* Becca Baiman
* Genevieve Clow
* Devon Dunmire
* Tina Geller
* Sean Leister
* Jed Lenetsky
* Michelle Maclennan
* Andrew Metts
* Sam Mogen
* Ethan Murray
* Cole Persch
* Clairy Reiher
* Alex Rybchuk
* Megan Thompson-Munson
* Brianna Undzis
* Mikell Warms
* Matt Watwood
* Chris Wyburn-Powell
* Ziqi Yin

Each day of the Bootcamp has a folder of files covering an important topic. All work was done in the Pangeo environment which can be found in the main folder (pangeo.yml). Notebooks are updated annually.

In each folder you will find:
* student notebook that has activities/code to fill out
* answer key notebook where all of those code boxes are filled
* Challenge notebook meant to be done by the student independently as practice
* Challenge answer key with the challenge completed
* Files of data that will be used in the above notebooks
