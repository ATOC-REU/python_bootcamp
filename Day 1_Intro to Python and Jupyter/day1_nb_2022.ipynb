    "\n",
    "### 1.0.1 Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming/Coding is the process of writing instructions for the computer to implement and execute. I think of this as the language of the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like human language it's complicated and if you've done it for a long time, it may seem easy, but that's because you're familiar with the rules and have had a lot of practice. When you don't know the rules and haven't had much practice, it can be hard or even feel impossible to understand what's going on in a \"conversation\", or program in this case. Hopefully, over the next week we can help you start the lifelong process of learning how to use computers to help you solve problems in climate sciences or wherever else you end up!\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, let's think about this by comparing this computer language (programming) to our human languages. First there are the types of words you use, which in both the computer and human realms we call the **language**. In this case the human language in use is English and the computer language we'll use is Python. Next, the particular way you say those words, on the human side is called grammar and for the computer we call **syntax**. These are the rules that we obey to make sure anyone (or computer) that understands our language can understand us. This bootcamp will help you learn these syntax rules for python!\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, knowing a language can be very different than communicating in that language. To listen to and understand English is different from speaking or writing in English. Just like this coding involves understanding what you write and program, **AND** it involves being able to share this with other people so they too can understand what you've done. This is where Jupyter Notebooks come in. Jupyter Notebooks are one of the best ways to share code with other people. You can show people how to use code you've made by giving examples and explain to them what different parts mean using these \"non-code\" blocks like what you're reading here.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you run more and more code for larger and different projects, you will likely not only run in a Jupyter Notebook to share your code with others, you will also use combinations of scripts, data files, notebooks, and output images and graphs."
