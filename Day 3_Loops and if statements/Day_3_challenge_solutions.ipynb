    "The goal today is to compare seasonal timeseries of the lidar 18m wind data. A suggestion of steps are shown below, but this code can be written many different ways (and more efficiently than suggested below). If you have an idea of how to proceed, ignore the comments! The comments should be used if you have no idea where to get started.\n",

    "    <br/> <font color='blue'>1. Make a plot or plots that compare(s) data from each season in 2020. The timesteps should be daily-averaged windspeed.\n",
    "    <br/> <font color='blue'>2. Write a description comparing the seasonal wind trends\n",
    "    <br/> <font color='red'>3. Produce the same comparison as 1 but this time, using both 2019 and 2020 dates to calculate the daily-averaged windspeed."
